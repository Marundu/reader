A Flask App that makes news articles readable again.

A basic Flask application for extracting the text of news articles and reformatting them for a nicer reading experience. It uses the neat Newspaper library by CodeLucas <https://github.com/codelucas/newspaper/>, and also includes a basic Google Chrome extension to easily use the app.
